# Weather City 

This is a weather forecast application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Setup

To run this project, you need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). Replace the `apiKey` value in the `script.js` file with your API key.

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API key
